--Hi there 👋

After deleting my old account i've now created this new account and will start from scratch 😊

i were always* 🤨 interested in tech since young age and i got to know about git at 13 but i was unable to understand it😏 at that time and some years later i deleted that account and created this account.

i will expolre here content regarding blockchain technology ⛓️⛓️‍💥 mainly and other things too but more interested in blockchaim tech

i would love to work with most peolpe except these kinds of people 🥸--

        --> atheists- who do not beleive in themselves, other atheists are always welcome 
        --> theists - who beleives there is god just because some shitty people💩 told them about it. Only those theists are welcome who had discovered god by themselves by any way
        --> agnostics are always welcome 🤝

-- only philosophy is responsible for any may and cause in human existence. if you know something like that then its good but if you dont know that's better

   always welcome to talk about anything on 📧-> albert@einstein.simplelogin.com
